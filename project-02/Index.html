        <h1>Shawn Morrison</h1>
        <p>Hello! I'm Shawn, I'm a husband, a father of 3, and I am very busy. I own a landscaping company, where I work full time, and we own a lemonade stand. I also have a part time job working for a local IT firm. I was elected to city council in May of this year, and I became a Deacon at our church in October. I'm going back to school to finish my degree so I can advance my career in tech and hang up landscaping for good.</p>
