            This is my collection of magnets from places my wife and I have traveled over our 16 years of marriage. Some with children, some without. We keep them on our refrigerator as a way to remember the fun times we've had together traveling the US. Each one has a special memory, and when I am cooking dinner or making coffee in the morning, I am reminded of the time we spent together in those places.

                <p class="details">Alaska Magnet</p>
                <p class="description">
                    This magnet represents our unforgettable trip to Alaska, where we explored the stunning
                    landscapes, witnessed majestic wildlife, and experienced the unique culture of the Last Frontier.
                    Every time I see this magnet, I'm reminded of the breathtaking glaciers, serene fjords, and the
                    thrill of spotting humback whales in their natural habitat. It was truly a trip of a lifetime,
                    and this magnet holds a special place in my heart as a symbol of that adventure.

                    Another of my favorite trips was to Breckenridge, Colorado. This magnet reminds me of this wonderful trip.
                    We stayed in a cabin in the mountains in Keystone, CO. We enjoyed hiking and exploring the charming ski town. 
                    Some of the restaurants had really good food and we enjoyed shopping in the local stores. We are planning a trip back to Colorado very soon.

                    This magnet reminds me of our family trip to Disney World in Orlando, Florida. We had an amazing time exploring the various theme parks,
                    meeting beloved characters, and enjoying thrilling rides. This magnet also shows the year 2020. Not many people were able to experience Disney without
                    large crowds due to the pandemic. It was a unique experience that we will always remember.

                <p class="description">
                    We were fortunate enough this year to attend a Bananaball game in Fayetteville, Arkansas. This magnet
                    commemorates that fun experience. If you have not heard of Bananaball, you will soon. It's based on baseball,
                    but with a fun twist. For instance, I participated in a root beer chugging contest on the field to help kick off
                    the game. It was a blast!

                    Our anniversary trip to Las Vegas was a truly unforgettable experience. We enjoyed exploring the famous
                    Las Vegas Strip, taking in the dazzling lights and world-class entertainment. We stayed at the Paris Hotel,
                    where we had a stunning view of the Bellagio fountains. We also indulged in delicious cuisine at some of the
                    city's renowned restaurants. This magnet serves as a reminder of the fun we had and the memories we created together in Sin City.
