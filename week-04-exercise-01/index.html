        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            I changed the text in the center to say "Do not ever use Wikipedia," I also changed the colors of the bold headline fonts to lime green, and the standard text to red. The color palette was a skin, so I had to change the color-base, the color-base-fixed, and the color-emphasized to actually get the colors to change. I chose these changes because I thought it would be funny to see a well-known website telling people not to use it, and the bright colors made it look even more ridiculous. I understood why some changes worked and some didn't after realizing that the website used a skin that overrode some of the default CSS properties. I was able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes I made, especially after inspecting the elements and seeing how the styles were applied. Overall, I do think I have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting my own webpages, as it allowed me to experiment with different styles and see the immediate effects.
